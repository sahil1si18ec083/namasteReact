<!-- First when the web page is loaded, browser reads html, as soon it loads, it reads react into our application using the react script tag, then it will load react dom into 
our app, then it will load App.js and inside App.js it will run every thing line by line and then the tags are renderde into the dom. IF there is anything alreday there in dom ,it will replace it and 
put the new things in root -->
